# webpack-template-repository
Template repository created using the learning from webpack Odin lesson

It contains the following folders
# dist
# node_modules
# src

It contains the following files
# .gitgnore
# package-lock.json
# package.json
# README.md
# webpack.dev.js
# webpack.prod.js

If your using this repo as template, you don't need to use npx instead you can use npm because we've already inserted the necessary lines in package.json under the "scripts" property which contains object within the object we have the necessary property "test", "build", "dev", "deploy". we also have the necessary dependency to run the webpack smoothly.
